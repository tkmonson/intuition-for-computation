    \textit{So many people today---and even professional scientists---seem to me like somebody who has seen thousands of trees but has never seen a forest. A knowledge of the historic and philosophical background gives that kind of independence from prejudices of his generation from which most scientists are suffering. This independence created by philosophical insight is---in my opinion---the mark of distinction between a mere artisan or specialist and a real seeker after truth.}

I find it difficult to describe what this book is. And yet, I find it easy to express why I think it is worth your time and contemplation.

	\textit{The very word intuition has to be understood. \\[5mm]
		You know the word tuition---tuition comes from outside, somebody teaches you, the tutor. \\[5mm]
		Intuition means something that arises within your being; \\[5mm]
		it is your potential, thatâ€™s why it is called intuition. \\[5mm]
		Wisdom is never borrowed, and that which is borrowed is never wisdom. \\[5mm]
		Unless you have your own wisdom, your own vision, \\[5mm]
		your own clarity, your own eyes to see, \\[5mm]
		you will not be able to understand the mystery of existence.}

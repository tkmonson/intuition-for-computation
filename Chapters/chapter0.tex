I find it difficult to describe what this book is. And yet, I find it easy to express why I think it is worth your time and contemplation.

% The hook starts here. Why should the reader care?
% Five reasons to read this book: 1. It is a work of passion, born out of a consuming and frenetic obsession, a labor of love; 2. It is painstakingly crafted, like a sculpture hewn from granite, every sentence carefully constructed, every word meticulously chosen; 3. It is a work written in the midst of a deep depression, and it serves as a guide to those who may experience the same feelings of self-doubt; 4. It is a distillation of some very difficult and important ideas that you have encountered and will undoubtedly encounter again; 5. It's short and tries not to waste your time...
% However, there is a reason that is bigger than all of these...

% The computer is the most important invention since the printing press. It is a game changer for mankind. The amount of science being done now is enormous compared to what was being done in, for example, Newton's time. Back then, there were very few scientists, and they used simple tools. The body of human knowledge started kicking into gear at the turn of the 20th century, and it took off like a rocket with the conceptualization and implementation of general-purpose computers. Before we did a few calculations a minute on a slide rule. Now, consumer CPUs can do \textit{billions of calculations per second} and supercomputers are well into the territory of \textit{quadrillions}. Human life has been immensely altered by computers.
% Computers are everywhere today. They are essential to modern life, and they will only become more essential. Thus, they are worth understanding.
% Computers are complicated, but they are built on simpler principles that were discovered incrementally as humanity gained knowledge. To someone who is ignorant of these earlier ideas, computers look like magic. Some programmers think that computers are magic, and yet they can still program, thanks to software abstraction. However, you will reach a conceptual limit if you rely on abstractions.
% As technology gets more complicated, it gets harder to understand it without this intuitive, foundational knowledge. If you see yourself utilizing computers frequently for the remainder of your life, the time to learn about them is now.
% The book gets more programming-oriented as it goes on. I am hoping that the book as a whole is compelling enough that you will not notice it. Even if programming does not interest you, the theoretical parts of the book will teach you how things work and the application parts will teach you how to make great things. If you are not interested in that, you should be.

% What is this thing? A book? A textbook? A work of non-fiction? A list? A guide? A handbook? I think it is all of those things.

% It's a book about programming, and a guide for software engineering interviews, but it's more than that. I think it will be interesting and useful for anyone who wants to create and analyze things effectively.

% Technically, a book is a physical medium that acts as the vessel for a \textit{text}, a written work, a determinate sequence of abstract symbols. Thus, I will refer to this work hencefore as a text.
% What is the computer equivalent of a text? A text file, an abstract sequence of numbers. Do computer files exist? They manifest in physical reality as voltage levels, yes. However, the recognition of these voltages as elements of a pattern is conceptual. This is the case for all patterns, for all things more complex than singular, indivisible objects. So the abstract, informational content of a story does not exist in physical reality, but a computer can contain an electrical phenomenon within its memory that can be interpreted as the content, given the appropriate algorithm.

%--- METHODOLOGY ------------------------

% I begin writing this so that understand it. Then, it got big enough that I thought it could be of use to others, so I started to write it in such a way that someone with less formal education than me could understand it. Then, I realized that in order to really get it, I had to write about these complex topics in such a way that someone outside of CS could feasibly understand it, given enough time and drive. I wanted to explain the insights one can glean from higher mathematics and theoretical computer science, and I wanted to do it in such a way that it was really easy to understand. This is intuitive understanding. Semantic understanding. In hacker terms, to grok something.
% The words on the page will not teach the material to you. They are simply there to guide your thoughts toward understanding. You have to spend time in thought to foster intuition.
% You might find the tone of the book to be conversational. This is because I don't know how to teach in any way besides conversation.
% More information does not mean more understanding. File sizes denote information - movies vs. books.
% This guide began as a study list for software interviews. What does it mean to study for a software interview? Is it just doing a bunch of sample problems? How prepared should you be? Is the goal simply to receive an offer or to be a truly excellent candidate? I would argue that it is better to pursue the latter, if possible, because it means you are building yourself, not just building a temporary performance that will be showcased at interviews. You make yourself an asset. Also, as long as you have only a surface-level understanding, you will always feel like a fraud who knowledge is fragile and constantly waning.
% The question should not be "How do I get a competitive software engineering job?" It should instead be "What makes a truly excellent software engineer?"
% While jargon is confusing to people who are not 'in the know', it is usually very descriptive. It paints a very precise picture, if you know how to differentiate similar terms. The English words that are used are often quite apt. Differentiation and integration as examples.
% There are a lot of jargon terms in computer science, and a lot of them are very similar. This guide also serves as a personal dictionary of sorts.
% This book champions a semantic approach to the content covered. I personally cannot be satisfied with only equations and hand-waving explanations for what they represent. This does not mean that it focuses on applied math rather than pure math. On the contrary, there is a fair amount of pure math here. However, good teachers tend to plot pure mathematical structures and explain them with metaphors to make them familiar. The philosophy here is that in order to learn something new, you must be able to compare it to something you already understand. If a non-trivial topic is 100% foreign to you, you can't learn it, no matter how hard you try.
% This book is written in a poetic/oratory style. It flows like a speech that is meant to be read aloud. I encourage you to do so.
% The book is slanted toward imperative programming, specifically toward OOP. This is because most software engineering is done in OOP languages. OOP is also less abstract and thus more beginner-friendly. Declarative programming and functional languages are discussed with a decent level of detail, but OOP is the default here. For example, the implementation chapter explores Java.

% What makes this book different from most textboooks is that it starts from first principles.
% The first two sections are top-down. Once we understand information, communication, and logic, the rest of the book is bottom-up. And then software engineering might be top-down again.
% Bottom-up is like starting from an arche, top-down is like starting from henosis.

% Why do people think they can't do math? What is so confusing about it to them? I collected some responses, thought about it, and tried to make this text as accessible as possible for those people.

% Blue boxes are tangential material and out-there concepts. One of the great challenges of writing well is condensing the tree nature of experience into the list structure of an essay.
% Make a chart with philosophy as a circle (a non-metric space) and mathematics, physics, engineering, computer science, etc. as bars (metrics spaces whose metric is academic complexity). The bars start at high-school level topics and extend to the bleeding edge of understanding. Draw two versions: what college taught me vs. what I felt like I needed to know. Syntactic understanding vs semantic understanding.
% College dug deep, raw tunnels into hard earth. <Drawing of vertical lines>. Writing this book connected them all horizontally, leaving lanterns at the intersections so that one could see all the way from one end to the other. <Drawing of criss-crossing lines and nodes>. Now, picture these tunnels instead as interlocking length of fishing line. With my net woven, I can catch fish instead of floundering in the water with loose strings.

% Computer science is not about computers, it is about computation. Computation is much broader than the study of computers. The concepts are everywhere.
% Comment on these CS etymology alternatives: turingineer, turologist, datalogy, flow-charts-man (hilarious), applied metamathematician, applied epistemologist, hypologist (study of what is under? as in under systems?), computics (like 'physics', the science of computational phenomena, great name), computing science (equivalent to computics, but not Greek and not as cool) automatic information (pertaining to automata), infomatics ("what can be conceived," pretty badass, similar to mathematics ("what can be learned"), unfortunately taken).
% What about the phrase "theoretical computer science"? The better term is computational science.
% Not CS: information science (more associated with effective storage and dissemination of information, not computation), information technology (a business-oriented discipline focused on choosing and maintaining hardware and software for a company), software engineering (the effective implementation of theoretical CS concepts for the purpose of building software)
% "I will rate these names based on accuracy, but I won't deny my bias toward the coolest sounding names"

% Chapters and sections.

% Interdisciplinary, historical approach.
% There are a lot of quotes. I like quotes. Plus, taking a bunch of quotes out of context (slashthrough) \textit{repurposing} quotes allows me to pretend like a bunch of smart people agree with what I am saying. And they all write a part of my book for free. Ha, suckers!
% I remember the death quotes in Call of Duty 4 (quite profound in their context, especially considering it's Call of Duty). Quotes can sound profound even when you are not mature enough to really understand them (like quotes about war). "War is delightful to those who have not yet experienced it." - Erasmus. "My first wish is to see this plague of mankind, war, banished from the earth." - George Washington (and then America goes on to be in almost constant war).
% Good quotes succinctly capture the essence of a hard-to-know truth. Mathematical formulas are basically quotes.
% This material is "advanced," but it is not inherently hard. If you perceive any material as hard, here or elsewhere, that either means that you are unfamiliar with it and you need to muse on it for a while (perhaps by covering more elementary topics first) or that it is being taught poorly.
% I'm not a PhD. Most people who write textbooks are. This is still a textbook. It is meant to be educational.
% I am not very old. Most people who write textbooks are older. (I learned much of this material as I was writing it. Most people who write textbooks know the material beforehand.) However, I think this is a benefit in some sense because I am not so far removed from my readers.
% People should catalog their knowledge in a professional format. We spend so much time and effort learning, and then we just accept that we will forget the vast majority of it. I remember cramming for my linear algebra final (a class I had no business taking in my first semester of college). A few hours before the test, I drawing some matrices on a whiteboard and I thought that that point in time would likely be the best that I would ever understand linear algebra. Beyond that point, my understanding would slow die. And I thought that was very sad. I also read that many software engineers forget most of what they learned about CS. That's also sad.
% Italics are used to mark emphasis, but the kind of emphasis marked depends on context. Sometimes, an italicized word is a \textit{keyword}, which means that it is a technical term and that I want you pause for a half-second to absorb its meaning. Other times, the italics merely denote a \textit{vocal cue}. Words from languages other than English are also italicized.
% Content is presented in a culturally neutral way and does not assume a great deal of prior knowledge.
% The book tries to get the point across that there is more than one way to think about things and that knowledge is built on assumptions, including the body of knowledge called computer science. While we must work within a box, we should strive to remind ourselves periodically that we are, indeed, in a box and that there exist methods of thinking outside of it. The theories and models we use today may simply be the predecessors of theories and models to come. The topics of discussion, however, are eternal.
% Traditional education is bottom-up (notice how stuff on Earth falls when it's dropped => that's because this law F_g=ma_g exists). This book uses a top-down approach (in the abstract sense, what is mass, acceleration, force, objects, motion, distance, space => given all of those ideas, we observe that F_g=ma_g happens in this Universe). The traditional approach is syntactic, this book's approach is semantic. The "top" in this case is philosophical and mathematical theory: large-scale ideas, objects, and relations. We spend a substantial amount of time talking about these huge, fundamental concepts and how they appear in philosophy, logic, mathematics, physics, linguistics, etc. Once this information theory is built, we use our newfound mathematical insight to model computation and computational phenomena (automata, DS&A, programs). In doing so, we develop a theory of computer science. We then use this theory to understand principles of software engineering.
% The abbreviations i.e. and e.g. are used frequently in this book. What do those mean?
% If there's a word you don't know, just look up the definition and keep going. That's basically how I wrote this book.
% There are times when I speak very precisely and times where I am more casual. I believe it will be easy to tell which mode I am in from context. If you see a lot of italicized keywords and dense sentences, that probably means I am speaking precisely. If you see poetic language, absolute statements, or contractions, that probably means I am speaking casually.

% Looking at a bird he says, 'Do you know what that bird is? It's a brown throated thrush, but in Portuguese, it's a... in Italian, a...' he says "in Chinese, it's a... in Japanese, a...,' et cetera. 'Now,' he says, 'you'll know absolutely nothing whatsoever about the bird. You only know about humans in different places and what they call the bird. Now,' he says, 'let's look at the bird." - Richard Feynman (recalling his father, The Pleasure of Finding Things Out)

% "So many people today---and even professional scientists---seem to me like somebody who has seen thousands of trees but has never seen a forest. A knowledge of the historic and philosophical background gives that kind of independence from prejudices of his generation from which most scientists are suffering. This independence created by philosophical insight is---in my opinion---the mark of distinction between a mere artisan or specialist and a real seeker after truth." - Albert Einstein

% Suppose your goal is to be a great musician. You can either fool around with the tool enough until you glean a sense of what works and what doesn't (play guitar, pick up music theory along the way) or you can learn the theory and use it to understand the tool fully (learn music theory, apply it to whatever instrument you want). You'll be making music faster the first way, but it will always be sort of mediocre and you'll hit a knowledge ceiling. With the second way, you will have an in-depth understanding of how music works and now all you need is implementation (learn an instrument, produce digital music, get other people to play your work).

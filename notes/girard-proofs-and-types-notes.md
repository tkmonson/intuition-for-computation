## 1.1  Sense and denotation in logic

There is a standard procedure for multiplication, which yields for the inputs 27 and 37 the result 999. There is an *equality* 27 X 37 = 999, where X is a *function* in the Cantorian sense of a graph. These two sides *denote* the same integer, but they have different *senses*.

To show that two expressions of different senses have the same *denotation*, an action (a *computation*, calculation, proof, table lookup, etc.) must be performed.

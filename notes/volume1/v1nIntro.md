# Notes for the Introduction to Volume I: Philosophy of Computation

Data, Information, Knowledge
It's hard to fully understand these terms because they are so general.
But, because they are so general, they are applicable to a lot of different situations, so they are useful to understand.
They can model anything? Does that even make sense?
We studied and used these concepts long before computers.
In this chapter, we talk about the histories of physics, language, and logic because that is necessary for some reason. 

In some sense, wisdom is obviously outside of the scope of computer science and software engineering. That is, it is not a part of their subject matter. It is not in any relevant textbooks or journals, and its study is not the direct focus of any expert working in those fields. But in another sense, wisdom is actually the ultimate goal of \\

In some sense, wisdom is obviously outside of the scope of computer science. In another sense, it is its ultimate purpose.
How is wisdom relevant to CS? Because wisdom is the ultimate purpose of life, and CS is a part of life.

Wisdom is the use of knowledge in the right way.
What is right is plainly before you. No matter how you try to obfuscate or twist it, the right thing to do stares back at you.
I associate wisdom with intuition.

Descartes, Meditations - he thought that metaphysical wisdom could be found by first doubting every thing that you know.
You may be surprised by the fundamental things that you take for granted, by how much of your misery and joy rests on pillars of sand. We cannot build an intuitive understanding on these hazy foundations.

Intuition allows you to not only solve problems but to see through problems. Seven Bridges of Konigsberg.

We must then be like babies. Cognitive bias.
Let us take a page from Hesiod and begin with the chaos of uncertainty. And let us also be like Descartes, building up from nothing.

## Alternate Intro

GP1: True names. Identity. Categorization.

One of the longest and oldest threads that can be found in the tapestry of human culture is the concept of the \textit{true name}. It is mystical in origin, appearing in magical and religious contexts as well as in folklores throughout history, and it is founded on the belief that certain words are imbued with the power to change reality. A true name is an expression of its bearer's true nature or \textit{essence}, a summary of all that they are, and so it is said that to know such a name is to have power over the person or thing to whom or which it refers. Like an arcane spell in a dusty grimoire, it is a precious and potent bit of information in the eyes of those who believe. \\

Of course, magic is not real. That is, magic does not exist in reality, magic is not a special phenomenon that science cannot describe, and magical incantations do not grant casters supernatural abilities. But the curious thing about magic is that its existence depends on belief, and it is, in fact, really and truly real for those who think it is (or it is, at least, as really real as "real" gets). And, to make it all even more complicated, depending on how you define the word 'magic,' the slippery thing has a way of wriggling itself into the rigorous and brow-furrowed discussions of non-believers who dig too deep.

The true name is a supernatural tool for nullifying supernatural threats.

Magic might be real... depending on how you define magic.
Magic and feelings. Axioms, starting points, non-rigorous ideas, pure meaning.
"Incantation" as slang for a computer command

GP2: Computer science is not about computers. Or, at least, it is not *necessarily* about computers.

GP3: Computer science is actually about computation. Ok, then what is computation? A process or event. Pops up in many fields of study (logic, mathematics, linguistics, engineering) and was eventually studied itself (making computer science a very interdisciplinary subject). Performed for the purpose of resolving uncertainty.

GP4: Confusion is our natural state. By means of our intelligence, we give order to our surroundings.

GP5: Describe data, information, and knowledge with the help of graphics.

GP6: Domain / Theory / Model

GP7: Computation can be modeled like a game. There is a game world, with game pieces of varing properties, with various relations among them. An agent is a game piece with agency (i.e. the ability to execute functions).

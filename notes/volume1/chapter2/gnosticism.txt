In Gnosticism, Sophia (Wisdom) yearns for the knowledge of the Propator Bythos (Monad, Godhead), knowledge which only the Nous has. She is the lowest emanation of the Monad, and she causes instability in the Pleroma by attempting to cross the limit or structure (Horos) that separates her and the other Aeons from the Monad. (She, a part of the Nous, contemplates the nature of the source of Nous; she represents a mind contemplating it's own existence, consciousness.) She falls from the divine realm of the Pleroma into the void, bringing materiality into existence (as it is dual of divinity), and she emanates without her male counterpart, producing the Demiurge. She hides him in a cloud (or somehow blinds him to the Aeons), and the Demiurge, as a result, believes that he is the only being in existence, God. He emanates Archons (Hellenic gods?), observes his mother to be the divine Forms, and instantiates the Forms crudely in matter, creating the flawed, material universe in which we reside. This is the explanation for the problem of evil. Sophia puts pieces of herself, divine sparks, in her son's creation. Some time later, Nous emanates, by means of the Monad, two Aeons: Christ and the Holy Spirit. Christ (the Logos, Word, cosmic order) reveals the Holy Spirit to Sophia (a consciousness observes the operation of the Universe and perceives the spiritual good underlying it). Christ tells the Aeons that they cannot know the Monad, but they can perceive it. Christ takes material form on Earth to tell humans the same thing: to know the divine spark within (gnosis) is to see past the suffering of the material world, past the flawed Demiurge and his Archons, straight into the Pleroma. When all the sparks go through gnosis, Sophia will become whole again and will return to the Pleroma, making everything divine and immaterial again.

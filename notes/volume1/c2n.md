# Notes for Chapter 2: Metaphysics, Natural Philosophy, and Physics

A paradigm is a context.
Intro: talk about the long-term trends of science (moving away from absolutism, breakthroughs can be made by reexamining the foundations)
Endurants and perdurants (substance and form)
Nous is awareness/consciousness/perception

CS is a closed-world.
Time in computer science is often based on the changing of state.

## Classical Metaphysics

Wiki: Natural Philosophy

What good is (natural) philosophy in an era of such sophisticated science?

What is... metaphysics (study of structure), epistemology (study of knowledge), logic (study of truth), axiology (ethics and aesthetics, study of value) and phenomenology (study of experience)? Make a fun diagram maybe?
What is ontology? What is an ontology?
What do metaphysics and ontology have to do with computers or programming? Or with OOP specifically?

### Mythology and Cosmogomy

The Universe was described imaginatively before it was described abstractly.

Religion, mythology, cosmogomy
We're not going to deeply discuss religion or any theory that says more about the supernatural than the natural. However, we will briefly touch on some ancient models of physical reality that are intertwined with spirituality.
Models are constructed within the "religion" of a society. This is not religion in the customary sense, but a spiritual, cultural bias, a set of guiding ideals. Heisenburg calls it the "spiritual pattern of a community." Religion in this sense does not have to be theistic.
"Two kinds of truth"
Religion helps us make sense of the chaos. A common theme is a belief in The One, an interconnection of seemingly disparate things.
The progress of science was held back by war, disease, and also religion. But religion is not inherently destructive. Science and religion discuss two entirely separate things. The mistake was in trying to fit science into a religious model. Too many scientists spent time looking for rigid patterns in the Universe that meshed with their religion, and they just were not there. The Universe is not a divine puzzle that holds the meaning of the divine.
In the same way that there are scientific things that religion has no bearing on, there are religious things that science has no bearing on (ethics). Science will not make religion obsolete. Humans need meaning, community, fulfillment, guidance, etc. Technology does not solve these things. Religion does (however, again, it doesn't require God).
We see a trend from anthropocentric to not throughout human history. We are biased toward our species, our intelligence, our planet, our culture, our language.
The cardinal sin of religion was making something personal into something societal.

Atomic theory of Hindu philosophy
Tao, Yin and Yang
Indra's net
Monad, Pythagoreanism
Classical elements, aether
Pre-Socratic atomist philosophy
And then came Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle
Kosmos and Nous, Plotinus

Gods are a good metaphor for natural events. People wanted to describe something that was more powerful than humans and seemingly eternal.
Polytheistic religions explain the complexity of the world with multiple gods with different personalities and goals. Monotheistic religions lean toward a god that is benevolent (an omniscient, malevolent god is hard to justify, given that we are still alive).
Religion can serve various purposes: a comfort and a guide in a harsh, confusing world; an explanation of reality and nature; a way to feel one with nature and to find inner peace; a set of rituals that serve to maintain relations between human beings and the tempermental forces of nature; a cultural mythology meant to encourage cooperation between strangers in agrarian civilizations; a promotion of self-discipline and perseverence; an explanation of the vast gap in intelligence between humans and animals; an explanation of subjective experience; an interpretaion of hallucinations induced by schizophrenia or psychedelic drugs; an indulgence in magical thinking and perhaps in the practice of magic; a framework in which one can contemplate personal struggles and express them to a caring parent-figure; a figure to whom one can plead for mercy; a way to process one's own mortality; an assurance that warriors will be rewarded for dying on the battlefield; an interpretation of death such that a future reunion with deceased loved ones is possible; a way to avoid existential crisis and the feeling of meaninglessness; a hope for salvation from this world of suffering; a piece of culture that unites a group of people (and perhaps gives them a sense of superiority); a component of national, cultural, or ethnic identity; an ideological tool used to justify political and social actions; a reason for the congregation of a community; a promotion of nuclear family structure in order to support children; a claim of divine right to rule; a justification for a standard code of ethics; a philosophy that may provide one with a sense of meaning and control.
Sensus divinitatis, sensus deitatis
What are the components of a religion? Mythology, ethics, rituals...

Proto-Indo-European mythology
Shamanism, totemism, animism, spirit world, animal worship and sacrifice
From polytheism to henotheism to monotheism (multiple gods means you need more justification). Dyeus. Aten. Really started in Late Antiquity though.
World egg (Orphic egg), primordial substance, hyle, matter
Son of God, rulers and kings.
Axis mundii. It is natural to associate the sky with heaven because it is bright (which humans think is good), endless, beautiful, and mysterious. Thus, a local people will often consider the holiest place of an area to be the highest one (usually a mountain). This is the center of the world, and the connection point between Heaven and Earth.
Similarly, familiar places that are close to the center are considered better than the dark, foreign lands that are unknown and scary.

One could argue that philosophy has been done ever since we could think. But philosophy in Ancient Greece was different. Why? Geography. Democracy.
Yes, other cultures had "philosophies" at this time, but the word in this case is referring to a \textit{worldview}. We are discussing philosophy in the sense of \textit{analysis}.

### Pre-Socratic Thought: Henosis and Arche

Monism and dualism (and other isms) are just simple, broad models or ways of looking at the world

Orphism. Dionysus (Zagreus), son of Zeus and Persephone, is dismembered, boiled, and eaten by the Titans (who are "white clay men" covered in gypsum). Athena saves the heart, tells Zeus, and Zeus smites the Titans. The resulting soot is mankind, with both the divine soul of Dionysus and the natural body of the Titans. The heart is then placed within a gypsum statue resembling Dionysus. This religion believed in transmigration of the soul, which Plato later supported.
In this story, Dionysus may resemble grapes that are ripped from the vine and boiled into wine (divine + vegetation = wine grapes). In Dionysian mystery religion, raving women known as maenads would get drunk on wine and incite themselves into ecstacy (enthusiasm) by shouting and dancing wildly. The dismemberment and devouring of animals (perhaps including humans) was also associated with these cults. Dionysus was depicted by satyrs, who are half man, half beast. These rituals were explorations of the animalistic side of humans. There was much emphasis on becoming one with the god and phenomenal experience.
Motivation for metaphysics. The One. The Being. The Real. Henosis (the process of unification, unity, or oneness). Henosis is the primordial unification of all things \textit{in perpetuum}, the present and eternal \textit{being} of everything. Henosis is heavily related to the principle of causality. From uncertainty flows the uncaused cause. That is, there is nothing certain at first. Then, something happens, and it causes something else to happen. These events happen relative to each other in space and time.
The One introduces a fundamental question in Western philosophy: Is there an Absolute? Is reality unified in some way?
The Romans referred to it as the \textit{universus} (literally, the \textit{turned in one}).
Arche means origin (first principle, element, the nature). Philosophy was born in asking what the nature of things was.
Physis (nature, growth) vs. nomos (human convention). The distinction was made maybe because the Greeks had contact with many different cultures interpreting the world in different ways.
Thales. Explaining things without the supernatural. From many things to one substance (the arche is water). Cultural reasons for choosing water. A distinction between appearance and reality. You can live life according to appearances, but you can also learn for the sake of learning. And it turns out learning can be useful, too (olive story).

Heraclitus. The arche is fire because it symbolizes change. Flow of time.
Logos (word, account, principle of order): the great computer program in the sky (or the Word of God, to a Christian).

Empedocles invents the classical elements.
Rebooting Hesiod's Theogony. Instead of gods emerging from the Chaos, let's try to categorize everything naturalistically.

### Democritus' Atomism

Time is an instance of the Form of eternity. The Greeks did not think about time like us.
Atoms come in different shapes that give different properties. The shapes also influence sensory perception (bitter/salty taste comes from sharp atoms).
Materialism, mechanism, naturalism

### Plato's Theory of Forms

Plato hates Democritus. Wants to burn all of his books. Plato's philosophy is an objection to atomism. Believes that there must be something divine about nature due to its beauty.
Plato is rationalist, Democritus is mechanist and materialist (they agree on epistemology though)
Plato is a substance dualist. The human soul is an element of the Platonic realm.
Essence precedes existence. There is inherent meaning in reality.

Elaborate on why spheres were chosen. The Universe was also a sphere.

Plato's criticism of Heraclitus' conception of time (wiki Heraclitus)

Plato associates the classical elements with the Platonic solids. He argues that they are not atoms but corpuscles (sort of). Also, the elements are not the arche because they are material.
Plato not very interested in matter. His arche is immaterial (triangles), not material (atoms).
Plato indentified The One with \textit{The Good}. Through philosophy, one uses the Nous to find the truth of the Good. The Good is the Form of Forms. It is the ultimate object of knowledge that allows one to realize all other Forms. It allows us to comprehend justice. The Good is why there is "divine order" to reality. It is the reason why things are intelligible and are not just chaos. The Good is also the reason philosophy and science are possible.

The Good is the Form of goodness. A thing's goodness is its purpose (or telos). Teleology.
The Good is the point of philosophy. There is reason to believe that there is way to exist and think that is good. We can find it with philosophy.
Aristotle's eudaimonia ("good spirit," human flourishing or prosperity).
Pirsig's Metaphysics of Quality
Stoicism

Neoplatonism
The Monad (The One, The Good) is the possibility of existence (dunamis).
The Nous (The Intellect, Mind, Reason) is God or the Demiurge (thinker and composed of thought, divine order, structure instead of chaos). It is an energeia (a thing at work) that actualizes these thoughts as the Forms.
The Soul (Psyche, Pneuma, Breath, Fire, World Soul) is an energeia that actualizes thoughts into existence: it creates a material, living cosmos in the image of the mental Cosmos that is a unified thought within the Intellect (a system of Forms).
Logos is the principle of meditation, which relates the One, the Intellect, and the Soul (the hypostases) to each other.
Eros is ideal love, a love for inner beauty. It is the path to divinity, a desire to possess the Good forever, a desire for immortality.

The Christian Trinity is similar:
The Godhead is the Good (the divine substance).
The Father is the Nous, the Son is the Logos (Word), the Holy Spirit is the Pneuma (Breath).
The metaphor is: there is a Divine Creator (or Mind), and he created everything with the Word (a speech composed by a rational mind) which he executes by means of Breath or Soul (the hot air of life). Just like a Programmer creates a Program that he executes by means of Computation.

### Aristotle's Hylomorphism

Aristotle is sort of a mixture of Democritus and Plato. Not entirely materialist, but not fully abstract. It's scientific, but also teleological. Democritus embraces physis, Plato rejects it, and Aristotle redefines it. Physis is defined by the four causes. Nature and art are both part of physis, but the latter requires an external force/motion. Thus, the natural world has a "soul."
Aristotle did not have a singular arche. But he wrote about minima naturalia, the most fundamental of which were the matter + form combos of the classical elements. He did not believe in a void, reality was continuous (big effect on physics and mathematics).

Substance != matter for Aristotle.
Rejects atomism, says reality is continuous (corpuscles)
Rejects an immaterial fundamental unit, believes substance is real
Four formal causes
Potentiality and actuality (properties of the formal realm and the physical realm, respectively).
Objects are characterized spatially, events temporally.
Mathematical objects and operators
Plato is rationalist, Aristotle is empiricist

"We (collectively, as humans) bestow globality on first principles inductively, promoting the said principles to the status of universal, often missing meaningful alternatives in the process." -- Alon Amit
Put this after Euclid's section?

## Theories and Models

Instrumentalism

Patterns

"Models of computation" (coming up in section 3)

Can we say anything objectively about the structure of the Universe? For example, can we say for certain that the Universe is continuous or discrete? Probably not. But we can build some very sophisticated theories and models that describe the Universe very well.

Wiki: analogical models
Medium - mechanical, electrical
Cardinality - N_0 is digital, N_1 is analog
Scope - specific-purpose vs. general-purpose

Axiomatic system -> theory -> model -> simulation

System - a bunch of interrelated parts
Theory - a way of looking at a system (syntactic, system-independent, but perhaps designed with the system in mind)
Model - a way to represent a system (or the application of a theory to a system)

Theoria vs. praxis (considering things outside of our control vs. considering things we can change)
Pythagoras considered theories a way of contemplating math

Scientific disciplines use math to describe parts of reality "in certain terms." Two scientific disciplines might describe the same thing from different vantage points. Theories as models. Scientific laws are not axioms. Models represent reality in some, but not all, ways. If they represented everything, they wouldn't be models. They would be the thing itself. In mathematical models of physics, statements represent physical phenomena.
Theories that describe the same phenomena may differ based on what their basic abstract objects are (particles, waves, bits). These objects are reference points, helpful abstractions inspired by previous observation.
Logic/math theories have axioms/postulates and theorems about formal phenomena and are interpretation-independent. Logic/math models are particular algebraic structures, abstract objects that satisfy a theory (e.g. a set S is a model of set theory, a group G is a model of group theory)
Scientific theories have postulates and laws/principles about natural phenomena. Laws are classical and are expressed with formulas. They are not certain, but are rather extremely probable and backed by mountains of evidence. Principles are modern and are expressed in words. They are "guiding ideas" and do not require proof. Principles can be violated, but you better have good reason to suspect that's the case.
Axioms vs postulates. Essentially synonymous, but the former is more common in math and the latter is more common in science. Mathematicians do not consider axioms verifiable. In science, postulates are about the physical world, and physics is verifiable, so postulates are verifiable. Postulates can be broken if contrary evidence is found.
Models do not *exist*. They are mathematical abstractions that describe reality. Some phenomenon might be "well-described" by a theoretical model, but that does not make it a signal, field, etc.
Table for model classifications: linear/non, static/dynamic, explicit/implicit, discrete/continuous, deterministic/probabilistic, deductive/inductive/floating
Models may die out if they have major flaws. However, crude models are still sometimes useful due to their simplicity (classical mechanics).
Theories are abstract models, models whose components are symbolic.

A model represents a system, a simulation represents its operation over time.
A computer program can be interpreted as a simulation of some aspect of the Universe and, at the time, as a little Universe in and of itself. The difference between this universe and \textit{the} Universe is that we theoretically have access to all of the information in the former. Whereas we are babies stumbling around in the dark of physical reality, we are gods of the universes we architect in digital memory.
Mindset (blue box?). You can think of programming as just sitting at a desk and typing a bunch of obscure mumbo jumbo. Or you can think of it as the means to simulate anything that you want.

Systems (language systems, logical/formal systems, algebraic systems, automatic systems, hardware systems, software systems, operating systems). All of these can be modeled in terms of information.

### Euclid's Elements

Euclid used axiomatic and constructive methods
Axioms come from Aristotle, formal definitions come from Plato

Aristotle's logic was two-valued. However, he did not fully accept the law of excluded middle.

The Greeks used geometry to get around the precision errors of irrational numbers. That's why they used line segments to teach arithmetic.

Elements is great and super important, but in some ways it held mathematics back. It was taught for over 2000 years, and many people assumed it could not be wrong. In fact, it is not considered formal by modern standards, and it is not a general theory of geometry. Critique of the 5th postulate. Non-Euclidean geometry, postulates of special relativity, Galois theory, modern mathematics does not treat axioms as "self-evident" but rather as starting points. Elements assumed many things to be generally true, which are not: numbers are one-dimensional, mathematical objects must be constructed, mathematics must describe the world as we observe it (2d/3d space, concrete objects), mathematics requires straightedge and compass construction, there is only one way to describe geometry. None of these are true, and modern mathematics began when people started questioning Elements.

Aristotle's metaphysics influences science for 2000 years.

Aristotle's ten categories
Moving away from Aristotelian realism, Kant supposes that categories say something about how we conceptualize reality, not about reality itself.

## Ancient Knowledge, Lost and Found

And then came post-Antiquity...
Why is it important to talk about this period that is often termed the "Dark Ages"? Well, one reason is that all of the glorious classical knowledge was "lost" for a while outside of Constantinople. Western Europeans had to \textit{discover} the lost knowledge of their ancestors, and they thought very highly of these texts. As we nowadays might opine in favor of "the glory that was Greece, the grandeur that was Rome" (Poe's words, not mine), these peoples revered this knowledge. The trope is common in science-fiction---a lost, ancient civilization, beautiful culture and technology in ruins, far more advanced than what is presently known---but it does appear in history as well, given the right context. Other civilizations (namely the Islamic ones) discovered the knowledge through trade and also valued it, and they built on it in incredibly innovative ways (algebra, combinatorics).
Rome comes and goes, classical knowledge is lost to the West for hundreds of years, but is preserved in Byzantium/Constantinople (Nova Roma)
Christianity dominates the Western world and academic work is done primarily in order to support Christian theology. Naturalism dies out.
Constantine I - lots of Christian theological stuff happens in Constantinople.
Some scientific work is done in the West during the Middle Ages, but it is isolated and there is little progress. Less than 1 percent of the world is literate.
Justinian I and the Plague of Justinian
Charlemagne the Great - the revival of learning
Islamic Arabs seek out and acquire the knowledge of other civilizations, Classical Greek knowledge is acquired from Constantinople, Translation Movement, the Islamic Golden Age occurs, ends due to the destruction of Baghdad by Mongols
Europe slowly recovers Ancient Greek knowledge, and academic work is done to harmonize Aristotelian thought with Christianity
The Black Death happens and wipes out half of Europe, scientific work halts
Constantinople falls to the Ottomans in 1453, Byzantine scholars flee to Europe, bringing their knowledge of algebra
The invention of the printing press allows for the wide distribution of information
A major religious schism occurs in Western Christianity (Protestant Reformation), prompting rebellion in science as well
Copernicus publishes De Revolutionibus in 1543 on his deathbed
Galileo champions heliocentric theory and is persecuted by the Church for it. "And yet it moves." Galileo's ship.
The Scientific Method (Bacon, Descartes, Galileo, Newton) (wiki history of sm)

## Particles and Forces

Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler, Descartes, Newton

Wiki - Meditations on First Philosophy (Descartes discards all he knows and develops a new metaphysical theory from first principles). Powerful statement on the importance of doubt.
Descartes publishes the idea of a "frame of reference" in 1637 (Fermat also discovers it).
Descartes founds the rationalist, mechanistic philosophy that early models adhere to (1644). Newton publishes the Principia in 1687.
Descartes develops the idea of a system.
Basic assumptions based on observation: continuity, determinism, casuality, forces result from collision, absolute space and time
Mechanics - study of the behavior of point/body/bodies subjected to forces
    Statics - the net force is 0, the net work is 0, the body does not accelerate (at rest or constant velocity)
    Dynamics - nonzero net force, nonzero work, the body accelerates
        Kinematics - study of motion of a body without considering cause of motion (no masses, no forces, just motion)
        Kinetics - take cause into account
In Newton's era, physics was described in terms of bodies, things with mass (atoms, particles, objects). Scientists followed a mechanistic philosophy (physical reality is simply the motion and collision of matter, the universe is deterministic). Newton was a mechanist as well, but made an exception for gravity, which exhibited "action at a distance." He did not attempt to explain gravity, but simply argued that it matched the data.
Newton discovered that objects would continue their motion if absent of friction, which is a pretty unintuitive idea, considering that there is always friction on Earth.
Optics - Descartes says light is emitted by sources, Huygens develops a longitudinal wave theory of light transmitted though aether, but people don't believe it because it did not explain birefringence, Newton develops corpuscular theory of light and people accept that.

Lagrangian Mechanics
Hamiltonian Mechanics

Blue box for Hume's Problem of Induction and Kant's Trancendental Aesthetics.
Hume states that induction is not infallable and thus is unjustified. Kant argues that while it is not infallable, it is still necessary and rational. Kant backs up the scientific method but argues that it does not constitute an objective truth. Science is not certain, but that's okay.
Critique of Pure Reason - there are other ways of being rational besides deduction
We can only have knowledge of what appears to us, not of things in themselves.
Synthetic a priori knowledge (the knowledge of metaphysics) is what allows us to compute mathematics in our heads. Math is necessary and universal, and math can connect a concept to a new concept other than itself (ampliative).
Religious implications of transcendental idealism
Kant thinks S+T are just human projections. Synthetic a priori. They require no observation and are projected onto surroundings.
Kant: nothing about the object's location describes the object itself.
Walking in a thick grove of trees and finding an overlook into the mountains. Your sense of spatial scope changes. Your mind readjusts.
Define phenomena, noumena, thing-in-itself

## Waves and Fields

In early 1800s, people realize Newton's theory does not explain diffraction, interference, and polarization (physical optics). Young and Fresnel develop a transverse wave theory of light. This is still a mechanistic theory, and, thus, it required an aether (as discussed by Aristotle). People tried to understand how an aether could exist if the Earth moves freely through it. Aether drag and wind theories emerge.
Similar theories involving mysterious substances ("imponderable fluids") were formed to explain heat and electricity. Faraday proposes that reality is made up of "lines of force." Maxwell agrees and develops an electromagnetic field theory, but he assumes an aether is required.
Michelson-Morley experiment discredits the aether. Lorentz and Poincare form a theory with a motionless aether that does not interact with matter. In this case, the aether was more of a reference frame. Length contraction and "local time."

### Old Quantum Theory and Relativity

"Old quantum theory"
Einstein introduces special relativity, which does not require the concept of aether. Time dilation instead of local time. This theory could be explained in terms of an aether though. The vaccuum of space is more like an aether than a true vaccuum.

Poincare LET quotes

Macroscopic physics is now modeled with relativistic mechanics. It is usually described with Lagrangian/Hamiltonian mechanics/field theories.

## Quantum States and Operators

Wiki: Mathematical Formulation of the Standard Model

There was and is a common ethos among professors of quantum mechanics that you should not try to interpret QM as you are learning. The relevent quote comes from David Mermin: "Shut up and calculate!" Many modern physicists disagree. We will approach it in the same way that we approach everything else in this text.

Modern physics (macro and micro) is described with the Standard Model (quantum mechanics + QFT). This model is imperfect.
Relativistic, quantum, and quantum field models are applied in different situations depending on the scale of space and time involved. Relativistic mechanics encompasses classical mechanics. It's just more complicated, so classical is still used by humans in situations where relativistic effects are negligible. Scientific computing has no reason to use classical though.
Energy is transfered due to colliding particles or radiation. The former is modeled by particle theories, the latter by field theories.
Mass-energy equivalence. Stationary objects have energy because mass is a manifestation of energy. Particles are not necessarily pieces of mass. They are more generally pieces of energy (quanta).

"The principle of the conservation of mass [...] proved inadequate in the face of the special theory of relativity. It was therefore merged with the energy conservation principle-just as, about 60 years before, the principle of the conservation of mechanical energy had been combined with the principle of the conservation of heat [thermal energy]. We might say that the principle of the conservation of energy, having previously swallowed up that of the conservation of heat, now proceeded to swallow that of the conservation of mass-and holds the field alone. - Einstein
Time dilation, causality
The principle of complementarity. Mass and energy (momentum) describe the same thing in different ways. Physics was originally skewed toward the mass view because it is more intuitive and concrete for humans.
In general, outdated models tend to be anthropocentric in scale for space, time, and semantic meaning (theology). However, less general theories are not "broken." They are still useful in certain scenarios (domains of applicability).
At small scales, things are unpredictable. They don't really follow laws. Things happen with certain probability. Classical laws are just averages of tons these probabilities from the same distribution, and thus, at human scale, objects behave basically the same way every time. The probability average is extremely close for each test.
"You can't step into the same river twice." Likewise, classical physics does not behave in exactly the same way twice. We do our best to show general trends, but the Universe is not certain.

In some sense, quantum mechanics supports object/event metaphysics. Fermions and bosons. Quantum fields of mass and force. Spacetime. Mass-energy. Identical particles.
QM introduces a conflict over scientific realism. Should scientific theories strive to literally describe reality?
Bose and Fermi statistics harkens back to Descartes mind-body duality.

Because QM is probabilistic, this implies that physics is nondeterministic. According to QM, we will never know the true nature of reality with certainty. We cannot know everything about every elementary particle.

Problems with quantum entanglement. With the Copenhagen interpretation, we maintain that models are NOT reality. Just because the math asserts that some real physical quantity has some value, this is not certain without actually performing a measurement. Theories cannot predict values with absolute certainty.
EPR paradox. Bell's theorem. QM seems to say things that are impossible. Throwback to Galileo: "And yet it works."
BIG POINT: It is no longer possible to adhere to both the principle of locality (that distant objects cannot affect local objects), and counterfactual definiteness, a form of ontological realism implicit in classical mechanics. You can only choose one of three: locality, CFD, and conspiracy (that nature only allows researcheer to discover what it wants us to discover). Most people choose locality (because non-locality is contrary to the principle of relativity) and accept that things only exist definitely when they are measured/observed. This is not exactly the same as saying that things are not real, just that we cannot assume that things exist when we are not observing them (e.g. there is no basis in me assuming that Paris exists right now because I am not currently observing it).
Virtuality is perhaps a more accurate word than reality. That is, we can say that the things that we observe have certain virtues, but we can't assume anything more. The phenomenology of synthetic experience is consistent with that of ordinary experience. Virtual reality is "real" in the same way that the world is "real."
"'[W]e have to give up the idea of realism to a far greater extent than most physicists believe today.' (Anton Zeilinger) .... By realism, he means the idea that objects have specific features and properties - that a ball is red, that a book contains the works of Shakespeare, or that an electron has a particular spin ... for objects governed by the laws of quantum mechanics, like photons and electrons, it may make no sense to think of them as having well-defined characteristics. Instead, what we see may depend on how we look."

Copenhagen interpretation claims that QM is a way of acquiring knowledge, but it does not attempt to describe objects in the way that classical mechanics does. It asserts that founding a model on entities or distinctions (such as particles, waves, and bodies) that are intuitive but ultimately unknowable, leads to incorrect predictions somewhere. Instead, it tries to make claims only about things that can be empirically observed.
Conjugate variables (mass and momentum, uncertainty principle). Derivatives of action. Fundamental interactions. 
Beyond the standard model: supersymmetry, integrating gravity: string theory, gravitons

But there is an alternative way of looking at physics that is quite different from the models presented so far...

## Information Theory

A pattern as defined in terms of information (Alon Amit). We study patterns in math and use them to model what we observe in physics. All patterns in the physical world can be described by information.

How would you describe a beautiful gown with information?

Bits and bytes and other units of information.
The base-2 metric system (kibi,mibi,gibi,...)
The scale of objects - an essay, a book, an encyclopedia, a 1080p photo, a 4K photo, a 1 minute 1080p video, a 1 minute 4K video, a 1080p movie, a 4K movie, an operating system (Linux vs Windows size), programs (little clients to massive environments like modeling softwares), etc.

If physical phenomena are interpreted as information, this gives formal meaning to the philosophical idea that "we know very little." Much more physical information goes unnoticed than noticed.

Information is similar to energy transfer. It was compared to theories of heat transfer done during the industrial revolution. When you do work, you give some of your energy to something else. The energy may also be interpreted as changing type (kinetic, chemical, etc.). However, this is also just an abstraction. Energy is energy. There are no types really.
For example, when you throw a baseball, you transform chemical energy in your body into kinetic energy in your arm and then you transfer that kinetic energy to the ball. During energy transfer, some of the energy becomes heat. But really, it's all the same energy. You transfer energy to the ball, and most of the energy manifests in motion, but some of it manifests in heat. Efficiency, then, is a measure of how much of the energy involved is doing what you want it to.

Entropy - transformational content of energy
Boltzmann entropy, thermodynamic entropy, von Neumann entropy
Maxwell's demon (the inspiration for daemons in operating systems)

Mathematical theory of communication, Shannon-Weaver model
What does it mean to be a good communicator?

Blue box on what it means to have an information-theoretic view of the world. Give multiple examples that do not involve anything digital.
If you are in possession of information that incriminates you, you want to prevent its communication. You can do this by destroying it (rendering it unintelligible to anyone), encoding it (rendering it unintelligible to people without the decoding algorithm (unless they are code breakers)), encrypting it (putting it in a safe or hiding it), etc.
If you have space or time constraints, you want to use language that is dense with meaning. You can do this with compression in space (removing all of the vowels, using acronyms and Emojis, using shorthand) or compression in time (writing in cursive, no decorations). Often, compression techniques naturally save both time and space (not only do smaller files take up less space, they also download and upload faster).

"The Universe is a simulation." It is possible, but not provable. It is not a scientific question. But thinking of The Universe as a simulation is sometimes useful, and there is no reason it \textit{can't} be a simulation.

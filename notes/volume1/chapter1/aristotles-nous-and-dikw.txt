• Passive intellect: bridges the gap between Physical and Perceptual, creates percepts (intelligible forms), performs autopilot tasks like speaking about something familiar, intuitive movements like walking, "flow state"

• Active intellect: bridges the gap between Perceptual and Conceptual, notices patterns of percepts, creates concepts (knowledge), assigns signs to concepts and passes them to the passive intellect for filing in the memory, capable of metacognition

The noumenal world emanates data, the passive intellect orders the data into percepts (information), the active intellect abstracts percepts into concepts (knowledge), and emanates signs (information) through one's stream of consciousness, the passive intellect receives signs and may implement the communication of information by emanating speech, writing, drawing, behavior, etc. The active intellect computes according to deductive logic, and it can perform higher-level thought by abstracting signs from its memory and representing them with another sign. Higher-level thought has the potential to produce a more complete and nuanced knowledge. Wisdom is the intuitive use of one's knowledge such that one emanates good into reality. The use of knowledge is intuitive when that knowledge is represented in one's memory as an ontology that can be efficiently explored by the active intellect. Intuition, then, is achieved by means of preprocessing, caching, and building a dense graph of typed relations (having relations of many types makes the graph higher-dimensional).

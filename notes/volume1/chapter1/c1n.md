# Notes for Chapter 1: Cognitive Ontology

What is a ... number, set, number set, quantity, space, map, morphism, relation, function, field, algebra, operation, algebraic operation, pair, tuple, combination, permutation, vector, matrix, tensor, shape, structure, change (w/ qualifiers like linear, quadratic, cubic, exponential, logarithmic), order, metric, measure, geometry, topology, infinity, continuity, graph of a function, etc.
What is a ... concept, idea, notion, object, property, attribute, event?

A type specifies how information should be interpreted. With the correct interpretation, you acquire knowledge.

## Upper Ontology

It is very difficult to build a linear progression of technical terms as fundamental as those found in this section. But we have to start somewhere. It would be helpful to have a root category: thing.

Dichotomy of Thing: every thing is either an object or a relation. And every object is either an individual, an attribute (or property), or a class (or set).

Descartes 
Locke (tabula rasa)
Hume (problem of induction)
Kant (transcendental aesthetic, noumena, phenomena)
Transcendental idealism is about finding which a priori concepts are necessary for conscious experience to be possible.
"Transcendental ideality of space"
The noumenal world may be a hyperspace. Many theories in modern physics rely on this assumption.
According to Kant, creating knowledge requires both sensibiity and understanding.
We are pre-programmed: space, time, causality, numbers, reflexes, sociability

Space is an intuition of outer-sense, time is an intuition of inner-sense.
Conscious experience requires an understanding of the self as a subject, an observer of objects. The presence of objects is required (i.e. you need to perceive something in order to separate one moment from the next).

SEP: Mereology
Model of hierarchical complexity
Double-loop learning

"A set is a plurality thought of as a unit."

Gestalt psychology, principles of grouping
We perceive spatially local, causally efficacious \textit{bodies} that persist in time to be physical objects. But an object can be anything that can be "thrown against" your perception.

Text (or copy) is a perceptual thing. It is not the same thing as words on paper. It is abstract, but not as abstract as the concepts it represents.

Wiki: Concept
Holistic thinking

Collection (unification, integration): ref(...) or {...}
Classes (sets)
Extension (natural kinds)
Intension (types)
An idea is well-founded if it has a defined extension or intension. If your terms are vague, everything you say will be fluff.
We only have so much conceptual precision. We can't keep zooming in. Thus, we arrive at some most fundamental thing: the atom (or primitive (which really stands for "object of a primitive type/kind")). Every thing is made up of other things, except for atoms.
Similarly, we reach a limit in the other direction. Universes are things that cannot be parts of themselves. They are just themselves.
Assimilation and Accommodation

Conceptual categories are "structures of the mind." Percepts are synthesized into a concept that can be categorized.
Try to keep in mind the definitions of "type" and "kind" in your use of everyday language. The quality of language itself changes entirely when one considers every word he or she chooses to say.

## The Hard Problem of Consciousness

Physicalists take one more step and say that the neutral elements are physical. But then there are those pesky qualia to consider. Can they be reduced to physical states? Reductive and non-reductive physicalism (or materialism).
        
Okay, we follow non-reductive physicalism to accommodate a mental conception of qualia. Will we ever understand mental states in the way that we understand physical states?
Problems versus mysteries
Temporary mysterianism (maybe, but it will require a paradigm shift in science)
Permanent mysterianism (no, we are cognitively closed)
Colin McGinn - there are four approaches to explaining something (reduce it, make it fundamental, claim it is magical, eliminate it from reality)
        
Eliminative materialism - the antithesis of property dualism
Dennett: Wittgenstein, anti-theist, verificationist, critical of folk psychology and the intuitive understanding of one's own consciousness
        
Quining Qualia (1988) and Consciousness Explained (1991) - Daniel Dennett
Qualia are... ineffable, intrinsic, immediate, and private
This description is unscientific, so qualia do not exist in this sense
Objecting to the intuitive understanding of consciousness. This is a vital part of his philosophy, that people do not understand their own consciousness as much as they might believe they do. I agree with this.
Most philosophers of mind are atheists, but Dennett is an anti-theist. You can see it in his argument a bit. He seem to relish the idea of obliterating the last thing that made mankind special: the Cartesian mind. He also dislikes intuitive ideas, like folk psychology.
Multiple realizability

Which one takes precedence: what we observe or what we can verify?
For Nagel, the axiom is that "subjective consciousnness is real" because we constantly observe it. For Dennett, the axiom is "only objectively verifiable things are real" because science presupposes objectivity.
Dennett is a functionalist. Functionalism requires only access consciousness. He doesn't deny that we experience a phenomenal consciousness or a "subjective character of experience," but he thinks that those private, personal experiences, in and of themselves, have no place in reality. There is neurological activity that causes us to experience those qualia, but the experiences themselves have no quiddity, no place in the ontology of the actual world.
        
Mary's room - Frank Jackson's epiphenomenalist argument (1982)
USE THIS TO CONTRAST NAGEL AND DENNETT
Defines qualia
Ontological vs. epistemic readings
Epiphenomenalism - mental states are caused by physical states, but have no causal effects on the physical world.
Jackson later becomes a physicalist
Cover weak reductionist, strong reductionist, and eliminative materialist positions on the problem
        
Facing Up to the Problem of Consciousness (1995) - David Chalmers
Qualia are not functionally analyzable (inefficacious, purposeless)
Panpsychism
Quantum Mechanical Dualism
The hard problem of conciousness is a subproblem of the mind-body problem, which also takes thoughts into account.
        
Integrated Information Theory (2014)
Inspired by Chalmers' panpsychism, assumes that consciousness (phi) is actually a fundamental physical property of feedback systems.
        
What kind of things are qualia? Internal and external sensations, emotions, and moods. Felt states.
        
Functionalism, multiple realizability (qualia are defined by the function they serve, they are realizable by means of multiple implementations, not just one). Animals can feel the same qualia, even though their neural architecture differs. Artificial minds can experience qualia.

Why is all this qualia stuff important for CS?
There are multiple universes we could consider: physical (objective, subjective (perceptual, conceptual)). In CS, we work in a conceptual universe.
Hofstadter, strange loop
Formal systems
Hardware and software
Cognitive biases. Computers do not have them but programmers do, and computers only do what programmers tell them to do.
Feedback systems in IIT have nonzero levels of consciousness. Consciousness is not a desirable feature of tools, so it may be worth designing feed-forward systems instead to ensure that we don't accidently create conscious programs.

We are not concerned with subjective phenomena (experience). We are only interested in sensory data that is organized into information and integrated as knowledge (cognition).
That is, we are not interested in qualitative notions. Computer science is an objective discipline. Assuming that the processor operates as instructed, it is actually a deterministic discipline (outside of randomized algorithms). Thus, we are only interested in quantitative notions.

## The Categories of the Mind

Babies:
They are most interested in things that differ moderately from their schemata.
Assimilation and accommodation
Schemata, habits, pattern recognition (memory) based on pleasure and pain at 1-4 months
Intentionality at 4-8 months
Logical thought at 8-12 months

Language: nouns (things and concepts) and verbs (actions (active) and events (passive))

Patterns, mathematics is the study of patterns

Infants understand objects (continuous, spatiotemporal boundaries) before they understand properties (differing features).

Categorical perception
Categorical proposition
What is a category? Philosophy and math.
In classical philosophy, it is a predicate or highest kind.
In contemporary philosophy, it is a class of things that share a predicate (or many predicates). It is a bundle of properties.
In math, it is a class of objects and a class of morphisms. An object is a set perhaps with structure (properties). Morphisms are relations.
What is a category of being? An ontological category, a category for things that exist.

Important: is there a most general category? If there were, everything would belong to it, and it would provide no info. Thus, we need to differentiate. This is what a category system is: an interpretation of reality, a firm partitioning of some phenomena from others.

Phenomena and noumena.
Thing-in-itself

Categorizing in other fields: history periods, biology taxa

An object is any thing that is suitable for thought ("thing presented to the mind"). Are all things objects? Who the fuck knows. Let's assume yes.

---OBJECTS------------------------------

Discuss how object and subject switched.

What is a metaphysical object? It's like a trope. It's a pattern that is recognizable, and it comes up frequently enough that there is a name for it. It's a description of some thing that often appears in reality. It is a \textit{type} of thing. We will discuss many of these metaphysical objects in the chapter Types and Structures.

Objects vs. events. Is there a difference? Maybe not, but there at least appears to be one. Humans have traditionally discerned a difference, notably in language. Perhaps the difference is only conceptually convenient. Is an apple distinct from its decaying over time? Is computer state really a meaningful object with clock speeds in the gigahertz? Is a thunderstorm an event, or just a system of many, tiny objects with different properties, all changing with time?

----------------------------------------

"Abstraction takes us further from reality but casts a wider light on it."
Abstraction allows you to handle large quantities of information as single units. This allows you to manipulate information more efficiently (say more, do more).

Are there abstract things at all (nominalism)? Is chess an abstract object? Is a novel an abstract object?
Concrete objects have substance. An object of spacetime is an event.
Is a set of books abstract or concrete?

---PROPERTIES---------------------------

Universal, particular, singular

Bundle theory, bare particularism.
has-a relation

The word data has heretofore been used in this text to refer to a multitude. In recent years, however, the word has also been used as if it described a magnitude.
Everything digital is necessarily a multitude of bits. However, these multitudes can be interpreted as discrete magnitudes.
** Old paragraphs on magnitude/multitude/data down in signals. **

All quantities are also qualities. It would be hard to argue that all qualities are also quantities in any meaningful way. For example, using millihelens as a quantitative unit of beauty. It doesn't really work.optimal synonym

---CLASSES------------------------------

Extension-intension (extensional and intensional definitions of class)
Individuals (urelements) and sets (individuals are deemed redundant in modern set theory). Pure and impure sets.
Subset, superset, class.
A natural kind is a collection of tokens that have something in common.

---RELATIONS----------------------------

Properties could be considered relational in nature. Something that we would call hard is really just harder than other things. There is no absolute hard.

----------------------------------------

Identity and Sameness
Identity is tricky in philosophy but easy in math.
Sorites paradox, Theseus paradox
Indiscernibility of identicals

----------------------------------------

Symbols represent objects, but they are not the objects.
Models represent reality, but they are not reality.
Exoteric and esoteric.

The syntax, semantics, and pragmatics of a language (relating symbols to concepts, and doing so sensitive to context)
On Exactitude in Science
Simulacra and Simulation
The desert of the real

Syntax includes grammar, phonology, and orthography.
Truth-falsity.
Programming is the conversion of natural language semantics to formal semantics written in formal syntax.
A high-level language just has a formal syntax that is closer to natural syntax.

--- ONTOLOGIES -------------------------

Maybe use abstraction/specification as your terms instead because abstraction is a mental process as well (link human behavior with logical structure).
Abstraction/specification is parallel to deduction/induction.
Abstract/concrete is a spectrum. An abstraction is a compression of subclasses into a single class. It is the identification of similarities between objects and the treatment of them collectively as an (abstract) object.
Abstract really means "not in space and time."
Hypernym, hyponym
Intuition is an abstract understanding that does not require conscious thought. It is characterized by generality. That is, it is applicable to many situations (without thought).

Subsumption - taxonomies
Instantiation
Aggregation, composition, containment

Generalization
Specification/Specialization

Generalization is powerful because it allows you to know things about systems you haven't seen before. It gives intuitive understanding.

We will discuss upper ontologies next. This will inform later discussions on domain ontologies for physics and computer science.

----------------------------------------

Diagram -> Generalization/Specification -> Top and Bottom/Type Theory -> Generalization is theory building, specification is theory using -> information is both fundamental and very general -> because it is so general, we need to pull from a lot of fields to properly characterize it.

Like branches that furcate from an old oak tree and fork into smaller branches toward the leaves, types spread in a \textit{recursive} manner, each one potentially a parent of arbitrarily many children and an ancestor of arbitrarily long lineages. As a \textit{type system} like this grows deeper and denser, more information is required to represent it. Similarly, any class in the system \textit{gains information} as it is specified and \textit{loses information} as it is generalized. Thus, a class of type T is \textit{also} of any supertype of T because each possible supertype represents a subset of T's information. For example, the class \textit{Car} is of type \textit{Car}, but it is also of the more general types \textit{Vehicle} and \textit{Machine}.

Naturally, one wonders about what might happen at the extremes of generalization and specification. Three relevant question-answer pairs are given below:

Is there a type so general that it describes everything?
Indeed, there is: it is the \textit{top type} "top," and it describes a special class known as a \textit{domain of discourse} or \textit{universe}. The names speak for themselves---the supertype of \textit{everything} describes the class of \textit{all things} under discussion, the \textit{universe} of relevant topics, the \textit{domain} of our discourse. "top" serves as a useful label in situations when type is unimportant or indeterminate.

Is there a type so specific that it describes \dots\ nothing?
        Yes. It is the \textit{bottom type} "bot," and it describes the \textit{empty class}, the class with zero members. It can be considered the type of an \textit{overspecified} class. That is, the class has been defined such that no object in the \textit{domain of discourse} complies. "bot" describes things that are \textit{out of scope} or \textit{nonexistent}. Thus, it is often used as the return type of functions that \textit{diverge} (i.e. do not terminate properly) or as the type of \textit{nothing} (e.g. the 5^{th} element in a 4-element list is nothing).

Are instances just classes that are specified until they have one element?
        Technically, no. Specification is a class-to-class process: a class is specified, and a subclass is the result. \textit{Instantiation}, the construction of a concrete \textit{instance} from an abstract description, is instead a class-to-object process. For example, in the above diagram, the class Y_3 is \textit{instantiated} in order to produce the object b (or, by reversing the direction of the arrow, we may say that b is an \textbf{instance of} Y_3).

Because a type describes a class, it is also incorrect to say that $b$ defines its own subtype of \textit{Car}. Rather, b is a \textit{token} of type \textit{Car}, a physical object that \textit{realizes} one of the many possible designs that fall under the class \textit{Car}. However, Y\_3 could be specified such that b is the sole element of the resultant class {b}. A class with one member is called a \textit{singleton class}, and it has a \textit{unit type}, a type with one valid value. The type of {b} would be a subtype of \textit{Car} that describes only b, but neither {b} nor its type are the same thing as the \textit{instance} b.

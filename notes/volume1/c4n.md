# Notes for Chapter 4: Logic and Mathematics

This section should cover the logical developments leading up to the emergence of metamathemmatics and mathematical logic. This includes things like:
Ancient Greek geometry
Aristotle's syllogistic logic
Euclid's Elements
Stoic logic
Boolean logic
DeMorgan
Frege
Peirce's Logic of Relatives (relational algebra)

"Of course, the objects of a deductive system are normally thought of as formulas, the arrows are thought of as proofs or deductions, and operations on arrows are thought of as rules of inference."

Laws of thought
Three reliable ways of acquiring information: deduction, induction, and communication.
Hume's problem of induction
Deductive: truisms via consequence, Inductive: facts via evidence

Gottlob Frege
Alfred Tarski
Noam Chomsky
Barbara Partee
Model-theoretic semantics

## The Structure of Proof

Proofs and models
String together arguments to make proofs
Tree structure of arguments
List structure of arguments
Data structures structure data in such a way that it can be interpreted as a model of semantic ideas.
Proofs structure text in such a way that...
Information is syntactic, data is semantic

## Intuitive Reasoning: The Oracle, the Seer, and the Sage

Seers have premises and conclusions, oracles just speak conclusions
Does intuition involve unconcious, preconcious, or concious reasoning?
Is intuition computation?
This book is as much about intuition as it is about computation.
In some sense, intuition is thought of as the opposite of logic (it has no argument or basis in reality)
In another sense, logical truths (tautologies) could be considered intuitive, so all of logic could be the product of intuition. Unless you believe that logic is objective.
The Oracle and the Seer are unique from the sage because they KNOW their truth is absolute.
Computers are honestly closer to oracles or seers than sages.
Buddhism - intuition is a faculty of the mind of immediate knowledge

## Logical Reasoning: The Mathematician, the Scientist, and the Detective

Deductive and Inductive (+ Abductive)
Mathematicians write proofs (deductive), but they also use creativity (inductive)
Is creativity inductive?
Human computer

Explanatory vs ampliative
Certainty vs uncertainty (probability)
Top-down vs bottom-up
Logical truths (tautologies) vs facts
Abduction = induction + justification
Closed and open world assumptions
Domain of discourse

Can computers induce?
Machine learning simulates induction deductively
Deductive computers, AI, General AI, Artificial Conciousness
Calculation vs Computation
Fuzzy expert systems "abduce"

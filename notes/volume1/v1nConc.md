# Notes for the Conclusion to Volume I: Philosophy of Computation

\textbf{Wisdom} is the capacity to think and act in a way that is right. It involves the use of knowledge, a prudent choice of means and ends, and a healthy doubt of one's own understanding. It is born of an acknowledgment of how little one truly knows and how little control one truly has. \\

The wise exhibit:
Realism
Gratitude
Understanding of folly

We tell stories about ourselves through the feedback loop.

Over the course of about 8 years, all of our cells are replaced (true?). Ship of Theseus...
The substance changes, but the \textit{form} remains in our memory.
We feel that we are people who no longer exist, that somehow that the baby in the picture is somehow us. But that baby is gone. Certain forms from its mind live on in our own.

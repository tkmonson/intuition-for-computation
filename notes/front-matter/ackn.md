# Notes for Acknowledgements

The process of note taking while writing this book. Deciding whether to put my thoughts into note-form, and, thus, potentially into published-form. The notes were the barrier between "that's stupid/irrelevant/misinformed/way too \textit{out there}" and "Perhaps---that might be a good idea\dots"
But I also adhered to the principle of "If it's really that good of an idea, you'll think of it again."
I didn't write notes about the people in my personal life who deserve and have my utmost gratitude. I had my ideas, but I knew that, in the end, I would remember those who I truly want to thank, and I would remember exactly why. Some things are better thought through with the heart than with the brain.

--- PERSONAL ---------------------------

DA teachers
Duke teachers
My good friends, those few people with whom it's never been anything less than \textit{real}, honest and earnest to infinity and beyond. Interacting with you all is what makes my world go 'round.
Parents

In addition, I also have a number of professional and academic people (and works) to acknowledge.

--- PROFESSIONAL AND ACADEMIC ----------

TeX, LaTeX, Donald Knuth
Robert C. Martin and his book \textit{Clean Code}. Like the book you are reading now, Clean Code presents material that is typically considered rather dry and \textit{compels} you to care about it. It accomplishes this largely due to its writing style and short sections. It isn't afraid to be whimsical after a dense section, and it has many section headers (sometimes more than one per page), which act as \textit{mini-checkpoints} for the reader. Clean Code made me appreciate narrative structure and voice in technical writing.
Luke Smith

Aldous Huxley
Bertrand Russell
Richard Feynman
Henry Rollins
Marcus Aurelius
David Foster Wallace
Paul Erdos
John von Neumann
Satoru Iwata

--- ECCENTRIC --------------------------

And last but not least, I have a number of somewhat eccentric thank-yous to give. Despite how unconventional some of these shoutouts are, they are nevertheless sincere.

Mystic and Skitty
Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld (Theory of Comedy, comedy systems, categories of comedic timing)
Anthony Fantano (When is a university going to recognize the great good you have done and give you an honorary PhD? You are more than just a music reviewer. You are a true historian of music and a great human being.)
DGR (It's amazing, what's going on with Mario Maker 2 right now. A cultural milestone in gaming, in my opinion. I may have to get back into video games for the first time since The Witcher 3 (and before that, Black Ops 1).).
Morinaga & Company, Ltd., the producers of Hi-Chews

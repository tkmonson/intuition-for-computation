# Notes for Chapter 15: Operating Systems

This chapter should focus on the theoretical side of operating systems (memory management, threads, locks, hypervisors, etc.). However, this content is inseperable from its history; these concepts were implemented as improvement to early, real-world operating systems. Nevertheless, a distinction is drawn between this "operating systems theory" and the practical, everyday use of an operating system in an efficient manner, perhaps as a means to write software. The latter content is found in the next chapter, "Practical Computing."

Multics -> Unix -> BSD -> GNU -> Linux

Here is what an operating system is. Here is the distribution of modern operating systems. These operating systems are called Unix-like because they are built on top of or heavily influenced by the operating system Unix. Variants of Unix include: BSD, GNU/Linux, macOS, etc. Non Unix-likes include: VAX/VMS, OpenVMS, DOS, OS/2, Microsoft Windows (which is a family of OSs)

In 1969, AT&T created Unix. It was originally written in assembly, but was rewritten in C by Dennis Ritchie in 1973.
AT&T lost an antitrust case, preventing them from getting into the computer business. As a result, they had to license Unix to anyone who asked. Unix became very popular as a result because it was a revolutionary OS. Unix is, however, proprietary.
In 1984, AT&T divested Bell Labs, and Bell Labs started selling Unix.
Richard Stallman started the GNU project in 1983 to create a free, open-source, Unix compatible OS. The project started with the programs rather than the kernel.
Linux is basically open-source Unix. It was written from the ground up by Linus Torvalds in 1991. It is based on Minix (mini-Unix), which was an academic, microkernel OS based on Unix. Linux is a monolithic kernel.

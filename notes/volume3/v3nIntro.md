# Notes for Introduction to Volume III: Types, Structures, and Algorithms

This is the mathematics chapter.
Look into the following:
Abstract algebra
Type theory
Category theory
Algorithmic information theory (Kolmogorov complexity)
Chaos theory (nonlinear systems)

"My math background made me realize that each object could have several algebras associated with it, and there could be families of these, and that these would be very very useful." - Alan Kay

HUGE POINT: An object consists of a type and a structure. A type is what the object is semantically. What does the object mean? A structure is what the object is syntactically. What is the object made of and how is it arranged?

Structures, not objects. For example, we are directly interested in list structure and only indirectly interested in objects *with* list structure. We focus on Forms, not on complex particulars.

An abstract structure of fixed information content takes up a fixed amount of computational space. What is the difference between a structure and a space? A structure is a space with an associated type that represents constraints. A structure is a particular kind of space. (Look at quotes on space wiki).

Why leave set theory? We want to explore proper classes, so we generalize set theory to category theory. Sets become objects and functions become morphisms.
Type theory is a formal syntactic language of calculus for category theory. Category theory provides semantics for type theory.
A mathematical object in something that exists in a mathematical universe. They can have many different kinds of structure. We are interested specifically in the \textit{algebraic structure} of objects.
An automaton is a mathematical object
Are objects and relations fundamentally different?

# Notes for Chapter 8: Computer Architecture

## Mechanical Computation

Computation done by humans mechanically with tools
Computation done entirely by machines

BB: Modern Computing is American
    * Discuss the influence of American computer manufacturing in the 1950s on the landscape of computing today.
    * Things like ASCII, early supercomputer stuff, cultural nuances from circles near Harvard, Princeton, MIT, Berkeley.
    * British stuff, too, but more on the theoretical side.

Hey, let's build machines to do this instead.
Wait, what exactly are we building? Let's model the problem.
Computation as a mechanical process vs a function.
Abstract away the mechanics, and a function becomes a conversation (input and output).
Computing is more than just math, semantically.
Structure of language, types of sentences (declarative/imperative)

Calculation vs computation. Separate histories.
Is a microwave a computer?
Modern cars are full of computers. Embedded systems.

We've discussed "computers" in many different ways (primitive examples, pre-Turing examples, theoretically).
The typical modern computer is programmable (in a Turing-complete sense), digital, electronic, stored-program, general-purpose, uses RAM, uses so-and-so architecture
Maybe some ubiquituous devices and "optional" components (like hard drives and I/O)
Maybe discuss some important non-standard computers (embedded systems, datacenters, supercomputers).

Signals, clock cycles
Byte vs word addressing

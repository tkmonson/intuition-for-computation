# Notes for Chapter 5: Automata Theory

Markov chains
Cellular automata
Concurrent models of computation: process calculi, Petri nets, the actor model.
Pi-calculus and ambient calculus

Good idea for a simple automaton: single, married, widowed, divorced legal statuses.

## Automata Theory

Wiki: verge escapement
Mechanical computers were born from mechanical automata, which were born from mechanical clocks.

Concept of automata
Models of computation
Computation requires state, transition, and language

## From Knots to Nodes

Explain what graphs are so you can use them to model automata.

There are no ends for each knot. A single knot is closed. Links are not like above.

We, however, are interested in the more general \textit{graph theory}, whose focus is on how knots are connected to other knots rather than on the structures of the knots themselves. A \textit{graph} is a drawing of objects and relations in which each object or \textit{node} is represented by a circle and each relation or \textit{link} is represented by a line or arrow. \\

The string above can be thought of as a list. Here are some other structures that are graphs (tree, grid, two linked knots)

Node is a joint or a communication hub in an information system. It is connected to other nodes by links or communication channels. Node is Latin for knot. So node/connection in information science, vertex/edge in graph theory.

## Concrete and Abstract Machines

Generalize this diagram (Good Automaton) to labelled transition system
Transition system is a directed graph

Transition system, semiautomaton, operator monoid
F-coalgebra => transition systems are classes (math object)
Difference between semiautomata and automata

The nodes could themselves be automata => automata are recursive structures

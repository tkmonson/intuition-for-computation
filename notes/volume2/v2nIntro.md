# Notes for the Introduction to Volume II: Theory of Computation

Mathematical modeling of computation (sequential, functional, concurrent)
Automata theory covers sequential and concurrent, computability theory covers functional. Together, they cover the prominent models of computations.
Computational complexity theory is a categorization of computational tasks.

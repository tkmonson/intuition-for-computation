# Intuition for Computation
## A Guide for Programmers and Curious Minds

*Note: this project is an active work-in-progress. While the final product will be typeset in the intuition-for-computation.pdf file, the .tex files (intuition-for-computation.tex and those filed under chapters/) currently contain the bulk of my work.*

This is an open-source work of non-fiction about computer science and software engineering. It also delves deep into some concepts in philosophy, mathematics, linguistics, and cognitive science.

*Motivation*

I think the full concept of *Intuition for Computation* is that education should be a narrative experience, that any serious, extended course of study should be told in the form of a carefully crafted story. All of the great ideas and theories of philosophy, mathematics, and science were built on the foundations of previous great ideas and theories, and so much of the why of technical jargon is historical in nature, bits of slang or metaphor, old loanwords from other fields or simply from the culture.

There is a web of academic influence that relates great thinkers to each other throughout time. These were human beings who formed relationships with one another, who wrote letters to one another, who read and cherished and critiqued and built on each other's work; they all experienced great moments of joy and despair, unavoidable hardships, and long periods of intense, active learning before brilliance. And there are narrative threads that can be sewn between these people in this relational web, and threads from seemingly distinct fields can be woven together.

It would be a serious textbook, but all of the formality would be preceded by developed characters, plot, and ideas painted in broad strokes. And gradually the technical vocabulary will be introduced, in context, by tracing etymologies and explaining metaphors, and it will be used precisely and regularly so that the reader begins to consider it all an intuitive part of their everyday language. They develop a personal ontology of these abstract concepts and can read mathematical and logical formulas and code like it is English. They are motivated to continue the hard, constant uphill that is active, technical learning because they are invested in the story, and they want to see how it ends. Imagine how inspirational it would be to have an education where you spent years learning the historical and human side of your field, refining your ideas from top-level philosophical questions to well-defined theories to systems of many models and perspectives, just as the chain of thinkers did all throughout the time before you, and to find at the end that there is no ending, only endless doors. Someone hands you a pen and advises you to keep track of where you are going and where you have been, knowledge-wise.

It would detail computation in all of its forms: as the manual process of writing out calculations to get an answer, as the movement of bits in a computer, as the cognitive act, as the writing of programs, as the building of software, and as the building of society. And beyond that it would trace the frontier: beyond here lies machine learning, and over yonder is quantum computing, and thereabouts is cryptography. And it would end with a request that readers consider the ethics of their work and take responsibility for what they bring into the world.

# Intuition for Computation
## A Guide for Programmers and Curious Minds

*Note: this project is an active work-in-progress. While the final product will be typeset in the .pdf file, the .tex file currently contains the bulk of my work. I recommend perusing both.*

This is an open-source work of non-fiction about computer science and software engineering. It also delves deep into some concepts in philosophy, mathematics, linguistics, and cognitive science.

This is a placeholder README. I will write up a better one closer to the publishing date.

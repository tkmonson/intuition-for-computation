\chapter{Future Work}

% As it stands, I'm proud of what I've built.

% This guide is currently slanted toward computer science. It ventures briefly into the territory of software engineering but does not go far. This is because I lack the required experience to write effectively about software development. I would like to expand this guide to include a more in-depth analysis of practical programming, but I need to spend some time working as a software engineer first.
% I also intend to continue my studies independently. I'm interested in delving deeper into machine learning, artificial intelligence, abstract algebra, modern logic, game theory, control systems, and automata theory. I may end up writing new auxiliary parts on those topics.
% I also have interests in music theory, music critique, fashion, comedy, Stoic philosophy, Buddhism, linguistics and language learning, game design.
